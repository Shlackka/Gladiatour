                <audio src="assets/audio/murmillo.mp3" controls></audio>
                <p>The Murmillo class of gladiators was easily recognizable by their distinctive helmet with a broad brim and a crest shaped like a fish (murmillo translates to "fish" in Latin). 
                   They were heavily armored, bearing a large rectangular shield (scutum), and wielded a short sword (gladius). Murmillos typically fought against Thraeces or Hoplomachi, 
                   providing a classic matchup of heavy versus more agile gladiator types. Their armor provided substantial protection but also meant that they had to be powerful enough to overcome its weight.</p>

            <div class="gladiators">
                <h3>Retiarius</h3>
                <img class="glad-image" src="assets/images/retiarius-gladiator.webp" alt="illustration of a Retiarius gladiator holding a trident">
                <h4 class="pronunciation">re-ti-a-ri-us</h4>
                <audio src="assets/audio/retiarius.mp3" controls></audio>
                <p>Contrasting starkly with the heavily armored Murmillo, the Retiarius was notable for his minimal armor and unique weaponry. This type of gladiator was armed with a trident,
                   a net (rete), and a dagger. The Retiarius fought without a helmet or shield, wearing only an arm guard (manica) and a shoulder guard (galerus) on one arm. His strategy relied on agility and cunning,
                   using his net to entangle opponents and his trident to strike from a distance. He typically faced the Secutor, creating a dramatic and tactical spectacle based on speed versus strength.</p>

                <h3>Dimachaerus</h3>
                <img class="glad-image" src="assets/images/dimachaerus-gladiator.webp" alt="illustration of a Dimachaerus gladiator holding a sword in each hand">
                <h4 class="pronunciation">di-ma-ker-us</h4>
                <audio src="assets/audio/diemachaerus.mp3" controls></audio>
                <p>The Dimachaeri were distinguished by their use of two swords, one in each hand. The name Dimachaerus comes from the Greek for "bearing two knives." Unlike many other gladiators who might use a shield,
                   the Dimachaeri's offensive capabilities were doubled, allowing for a ferocious and aggressive fighting style. This gladiator type wore light armor, 
                   emphasizing mobility and the ability to launch a relentless assault on their foes, making them popular and feared in equal measure.</p>

                <h3>Hoplomachus</h3>
                <img class="glad-image" src="assets/images/hoplomachus-gladiator.webp" alt="illustration of a Hoplomachus gladiator holding a spear and a round shield">
                <h4 class="pronunciation">hop-lo-ma-kus</h4>
                <audio src="assets/audio/hoplomachus.mp3" controls></audio>
                <p id="glad-last">Originating as a kind of tribute to Greek hoplites, the Hoplomachus was equipped similarly to a Murmillo but with lighter armor. He carried a small round shield (parmula), 
                   a spear, and a dagger—weapons inspired by Greek military gear. The Hoplomachus was a versatile fighter, using the spear for ranged attacks and the dagger for close combat. 
                   Typically pitted against the Murmillo or Thraex, the Hoplomachus needed to blend the use of his spear and shield effectively to manage the different ranges of combat.</p>
