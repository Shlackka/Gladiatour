# Gladiatour

Gladiatour is an educational website designed to immerse visitors into the interesting history of th gladiatorial games and the people who fought in them. The site has accessibility as one of it's key features meaning not only should it flow nicely but it should be enjoyable to all, more of these features will be highlighted below.

My hope is that with the information provided, and the way in which it is presented, more people will be encouraged to go and delve even deeper into this extraordinary part of our shared past.

## Features

Below I will go into a brief explanation of the features I have encorporated into the site.

### Existing Features

- _Navigation Bar_

    - Shown at the top of all pages within the site, the navigation or 'nav' bar will make traversing the site as easy as it can be without having to resort to using any of the browsers navigation options.
    - The nav bar is also fully responsive meaning even when viewing on a mobile or tablet it should be just as easy without sacraficing the quality of the experience.
